## 2026-07-21 — CWS-AUDIT-001

Agent: GPT/Codex  
Status: Completed

### Objective

Audit the repository and compare it against the CWS Operating System definition.

### Steps completed

1. Reviewed the stack and routing approach.
2. Inspected existing docs and memory files.
3. Confirmed the repo is Vite + React Router.

### Files inspected

- package.json
- docs/product-definition.md

### Files changed

- None

### Decisions

- A schema-only next step is safest.

### Issues discovered

- `/admin` is already used by the legacy publishing workflow.

### Next action

Request an architecture review before adding new tables.

### Reusable learning

Name collisions with existing subsystems should be resolved before schema work starts.
